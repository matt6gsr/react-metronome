## METRONOME APP

I followed a tutorial on how to make this small metronome app to sharpen my ReactJS knowledge, but refactored where possible.
Simply press Start to start the metronome and used the slider to increase or decrease the speed. Press stop when can't stand it anymore.

## Getting Started

To explore this project locally, clone the repo address and using the terminal window run the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/matt6gsr/react-metronome.git
```

Node.js is required to run the development instance. To check node is installed on your machine, in the terminal run the command:

```
node -v
```

If Node.js is not installed on your machine, please visit the link below for installation instructions

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

CD into this repo/folder:

```
cd metronome-app
```

To install the required dependencies, run the command:

```
npm install
```

To start the Metronome instance locally, please run the command:

```
npm run start
```

This will start the app running on localhost, port 3000 for you to view in your browser.
